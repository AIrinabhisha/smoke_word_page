# smoke-word-page
I developed smoke word using html and css.  It seems like you want to create a "smoke" effect using HTML and CSS. While HTML and CSS alone can't produce a true smoke effect (as that would require complex animations and graphics), you can create a simple representation of smoke using CSS for shapes and animations.
